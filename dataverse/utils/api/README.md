# API
> This is a collection of API utilities for external sources

## ðŸ¥¹ Use `original API` as much as you can
> **Recommend to use the `original API` as much as you can** rather than using this `wrapper`. **Because `original API` is universal and this `wrapper` is not.**

This is just for **ease usage of some external sources**. This is not a MUST to use. If you feel like you can do it yourself, please do so.
