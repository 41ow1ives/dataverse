# Deduplication
> Deduplication is the process of removing duplicate records from a dataset.

Normally this is clustered in 2 big categories:
- **Exact Deduplication**: remove exact duplicate records
- **Fuzzy Deduplication**: remove records that are similar to each other

☣️ **caveat**️ ☣️
> When we cluster sub-categories with just 2 big categories, it seems waste of space. So here temporalily we cluster sub-categories with more detailed categories.

- levenstein distance
- minhash
- etc

But we will change this to much better cluster in the future. And we need your help!

💡Any ideas are welcomed!💡
